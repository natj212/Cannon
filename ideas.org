* Ideas

** Have different Cannons you can purchase

   - Have one cannon that shoots a rocket that travels straight and leave cloud particles behind
   - Have one cannon that shoots 3 balls instead of one
     - Each ball would be smaller
   - Have a cannon that shoots a laser which slowly degrades enemies till they go away
     - Have the enemies get darker or something to show they're getting destroyed
   - Have exploding cannon balls that can destroy a range of enemies

** Track a lot of different things

   - Track the accuracy
   - Track number of each enemy killed
   - Track time

** Have bonus items pop up

   Each item would show up randomly on the screen and you'd have to hit it to get the bonus

   - Coins that give you bonus money
   - Extra hearts
   - Power ups that make you shoot faster
     
* Enemy ideas
 - A drone that spawns balloons and has 4 rotors you have to take out
 - A slime that when you hit it splits into 2 slimes
 - A paper airplane that moves quite fast
 - An enemy that rotates around the center spawning balloons
   - Maybe it's a hot air balloon
 - A time bomb that stays in one spot and if you don't take it out in time it explodes losing you a heart
   - Maybe shoots a projectile when it explodes to communicate that it takes out a heart. Or have a screen
     wide effect to communicate the lost heart
   - Either make it look like a pipe bomb with a blinking red light that beeps quicker or a big circular bomb
     that's fuse burns down

* Todo
** TODO Add highscore
** TODO Add items to purchase
   Have it so you can upgrade the reload speed, cannon turning speed, cannon power
** TODO Add extra enemy
   Probably go with the time bombs
** TODO Pause menu with settings
   Figure out settings later
